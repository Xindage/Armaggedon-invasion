Project complex armageddon invasion 2

About:
This is a unofficial edit of the mod Armaggedon invasion 2, all data contained 
here use ALL or Parcial data from armageddon2v63.pk3 there's no intention from 
my side (Xindage) to steal credits from their work on that.

Copyright:
My Attempt on finding the authors failed, my contact with CutManMike via e-mail 
wanst asnwered. Original armageddon2v63 credits is included whitin the files of 
this github repository in credits.txt intact to be consulted.

Target:
This project is aimed in both fixing, improving and making it compatible with 
complex doom as an add-on for 27a5.
If possible too update the present armaggedon monsters to fit in the complex 
doom theme, having brightmaps for example.

Why Complex Doom:
This mod is widely used in zandronum multiplayer and after doing a small 
patch to make both work togheter, the players reacted positively to that.
About my choice on using the version 27a5 for that, is because it's the most 
recent version of complex, which add updated features and has less chance of 
being outdated.

Armaggedon status:
This project seems to be not in development for the original authors for years, 
and a project with such quality it's getting OLD in a bad way, glitchs started 
to appear and some waves break badly at point of soft locking the map or 
crashining the server, diabolist attack for example.

Signal 11 Crash:
So far Zandronum team has a opened ticket on it but i think that i found the 
source of this glitch, being the random sphere behaviour in complex doom, that 
is why the server crash, so for now this sphere will be banished from the maps 
until zandronum team finds a solution.
Check https://zandronum.com/tracker/view.php?id=3415 for more details about it.

About me:
I'm basically a mapper, i do know decorate and scripting well enough to 
understand and edit them properly.

Thanks:
Thanks for Wario, Moti and CutmanMike and everyone else included for doing this 
awsome mod.

Release:
There's no stable or beta release of this project yet.
The compat fix works with the Signal 11 crash still present and i'll not update 
that file anymore. Please be patient for a beta release.
